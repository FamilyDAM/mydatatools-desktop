FamilyD.A.M. | Digital Asset Manager for Families
==============

FamilyDAM started with one idea - there has to be a better option than windows explorer to organize, browse and search all of our family files.

Families today are starting to drown in digital files, a simple file browser is not longer an easy to use option when you have tens of thousands of photos. Or thousands of mp3 song files, or years of document archives. 

At the same time we are spreading our digital files across the internet. However, just like corporations families need a central source of truth for all of these files. An archive or a backup of everything we share online.
